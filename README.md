# Description
Current intelligent matching systems in the market face the challenge of poor search quality, although they try to solve this problem. Traditional keyword-based search methods may not be able to understand the semantics and context of product descriptions well, leading to inaccurate matching results. This is especially true in areas involving complex descriptions, for example, "orange-flavored chocolate cake" may be incorrectly identified as orange or chocolate, but not accurately categorized as "food - bakery - pastry". In order to solve this problem, we are committed to developing a large language model-based financial automated coding system optimized for tax classification accuracy and efficiency. By introducing advanced natural language processing technology and utilizing the powerful semantic analysis and generalization capabilities of the Big Model, our system aims to improve the accuracy of automatic classification of commodity descriptions in the tax filing process, thereby reducing the manual workload of enterprises in financial processing and improving the efficiency and accuracy of the invoicing process.

# Features
- **Generalizability**: our model is not trained based on the existing correspondence between goods and codes, but only makes judgments autonomously based on the descriptions of each code, so it has better generalizability. For the goods he has never seen before or the newly appeared goods on the market, as long as the description is given to the model, it will be able to give a more accurate classification.
- **Multimodality**: Our model is not based on traditional data, but accesses a vector database, which has the advantage of containing not only textual information, but also multimodal information such as images and sounds. Therefore, in the future, we can realize advanced functions such as scanning goods with a camera and automatically converting them into tax service codes.
- **Interpretability**: We can not only give the classification, but also tell you why it is so, and explain the index of classification in detail. For human confusing errors, we can tell the model by prompt engineering, so that the model can avoid similar errors.
